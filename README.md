## Project Overview
This is the Rails API part of my Health Tracker app, the [health-tracker-react](https://github.com/ninalouw/health-tracker-react) front-end is built in React with Redux. It is inspired by the [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/app) app, and allows users to track and visualize their calorie intake, macronutrients and calories per meal. It also allows them to set calorie and weight targets.
